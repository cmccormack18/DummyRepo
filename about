<h2>Project Homeblock - A New Generation of Smart Housing</h2>

<p>
Project HomeBlock was created in response to the pandemic flight of refugees 
fleeing the intensified sectarian conflict of the Syrian Civil War. The 
humanitarian challenges that arose from the massive influx of asylum seekers 
in Europe brought the world's attention to a global problem. Not only has the 
hardship of Syrian refugees been brought into the spotlight, but the broader 
issue of displacement and widespread homelessness has been made strikingly 
clear. By providing affordable and space-conscious housing, we aim to supply 
temporary shelter to those in transit, waiting to be approved for asylum, or 
hosted in under-developed countries.
